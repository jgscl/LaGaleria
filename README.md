# La Galería - Python based clothing web comparator
My Bachelor's thesis. This project wants to give an answer to the huge quantity of businesses and
garments that are in the textile market for young people with the development of a web application
where an easy comparation and classification of clothes can be made based on a few
parameters of some of the most leading brands in this sector: Zara, H&M and Carhartt
WIP. This application will use a search algorithm for clothes in those companies’ websites
and will get data from the clothes regularly to later process and present it easily to the
users thanks to a web interface. This method of extracting the data is called web scraping
and it is also used by famous websites like Rastreator or SkyScanner.
The process of building the application is divided in two phases. The first one consists of
doing research of the singularities of each web, where the structures of the product’s pages
and the different parts of them have been studied. The second part consists of the
development itself : the clothing search algorithm is implemented applying all the
knowledge that has been taken from the research phase in order to be able to present to
the user th at extracted data attractively with a web application.
The technologies that have been used are the Python programming language, that
nowadays leads this kind of projects, and two frameworks t hat use this language, Scrapy,
a web scraping oriented framework leader in performance and Flask, a web
development oriented framework.
