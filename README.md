# La Galería - Python based clothing web comparator
My Bachelor's thesis. This project wants to give an answer to the huge quantity of businesses and
garments that are in the textile market for young people with the development of a web application
where an easy comparation and classification of clothes can be made based on a few
parameters of some of the most leading brands in this sector: Zara, H&M and Carhartt
WIP. This application will use a search algorithm for clothes in those companies’ websites
and will get data from the clothes regularly to later process and present it easily to the
users thanks to a web interface.

The technologies that have been used are the Python programming language, that
nowadays leads this kind of projects, and two frameworks that use this language, Scrapy,
a web scraping oriented framework leader in performance and Flask, a web
development oriented framework.

All the code and documentation is in Spanish.

## Project Architecture
The "src" directory contains two directories itself. The "prendas" directory has all the search
algorithm code and the "galeria" directory has all the code related to the web application.
